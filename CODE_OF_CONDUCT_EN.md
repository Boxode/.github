# Visual Tradex Open Source - Code of Conduct (EN)

This project has adopted the open source code of conduct of Visual Tradex

----

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the <a href="https://www.github.com/VisualTradex">@VTX</a> community, as well as the steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to creating a welcoming and inspiring community for all. Anyone who violates the code of conduct may be banned from the community.


Our open source community strives to:

* **Be kind and patient:** We know that we all have different levels of knowledge in the field of programming, and if possible we can improve together.
* **Be Welcoming:** We are constantly striving to be a welcoming and supportive community for people of different backgrounds and identities. These include any member's race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, age, beliefs, etc.
* **Be considerate:** Remember that your work may be used by other people and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make about this may affect users, colleagues and even you.
* **Be Respectful:** Not everyone will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for bad behavior and bad manners. We can all experience frustration from time to time, but we can't let that frustration turn into a personal attack.
* **Be careful with the words you choose:** We are a community of professionals and therefore we must conduct ourselves as professionals. Be kind to others. Do not insult or belittle other beginners. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviors are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
     * Threats or explicit language.
     * Jokes and discriminatory language.
     * Post sexual or violent content.
     * Post (or threaten to post) other people's identifying information.
     * Personal insults, especially those that use racist or sexist terms.
     * Unwanted sexual attention.
     * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone can make you stop, then stop.
* **When we disagree, try to understand why:** Disagreements happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and divergent opinions constructively. Remember that we are different. The strength of our community is due to diversity, people with a wide range of origins. Do not forget that blaming someone will not lead to anything. Instead of focusing on that, try to help solve problems and learn from mistakes.

## Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for everyone. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that everyone is the same. Every time a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been hurt or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and to do everything possible to correct the mistake.

While this list may be exhaustive, we explicitly respect diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, creed, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We do not tolerate any discrimination based on any of the above protected characteristics, including participants with disabilities.

## Report a problem

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:opensource@visual-tradex.com">opensource.VTX@fabianhmz.dev</a> . All submitted reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

* Contact information.
* Names (real, nicknames, pseudonyms) of the people involved. If there are additional witnesses, include them as well. The account of what happened and whether you believe the incident is continuing. if a record is publicly available (example: emails, users, etc), include a link.
* Any additional information that may be useful to speed up the process.

After submitting your report, a representative will contact you personally. If the person harassing you is part of the team, they will refrain from handling your incident. A representative will then report the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision on how to respond. We will honor requests for confidentiality in order to protect victims of abuse.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to do so immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the representative may take any action he deems appropriate, including a permanent ban from our community without notice.
